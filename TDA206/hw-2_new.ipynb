The special case when all subsets $e \\in E$ have size exactly $2$ corresponds to the familiar case of a graph. A vertex cover in such a hypergraph is a subset $U \\subseteq V$ such that $e \\cap U \\not = \\emptyset$ for each $e \\in E$ (note that this reduces to the usual vertex cover in graphs). Show that the problem of finding interpreters can be formulated as a vertex cover problem in a sutable hypergraph.\n",
    "* (4 points) Develop a ILP formulation to finding the vertex cover of minimum cost in a hypergraph. The hypergraph can be represented as a $|V| \\times |E|$ binary matrix $A$ where $A[i,j] = 1$ iff vertex $i$ is in edge $j$ and 0 otherwise. The costs for vertices are in an array $\\texttt{c}$ where the cost of picking vertex $i$ is $c[i]$. Use the ILP formulation for the VC problem to hire the cheapest set of interpreters such that all languages are covered. Input the data above manuallly and solve it using **CVXPY**'s integer solver.\n",

    "Consider the ILP and its LP relaxation corresponding to the VC problem for the graph $G$ given in the data file. This is a ***random graph*** $G(n,p)$ with $n=100$ vertices generated as follows: for each pair of vertices **independently**, we add an edge with probability $p=0.1$ (so the graph has about 1000 edges).\n",

    "* **c**. (6 points) Consider the following rounding rule: we build up the vertex cover incrementally starting with $S:= \\emptyset$. Now consider the edges in $G$ in any order. If an edge $(u,v)$ is already covered by a vertex in $S$, do nothing. Otherwise add to $S$ the vertex $u$ if $x^*(u) \\geq x^*(v)$, or $v$ otherwise (where ${\\bf x}^*$ is the LP optimum solution computed in part (b).  Comment why this also results in a vertex cover and has cost no more than that corresponding to the rounding rule in part (b). Compare the cost of the solution produced by this rule to the optimal solution."
