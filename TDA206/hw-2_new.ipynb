    "<!-- Comment why this also results in a vertex cover and has cost no more than that corresponding to the rounding rule in part (b).  -->\n",
    "This algorithm creates a valid vertex cover since it iterates through the edges $e_i = (u,v) $ and checks whether $u \\in S$ or $v \\in S$ and if not, adds either vertix to $S$ (based on the weight computed in the LP). In our graph, all vertices have the same weight $(0.5)$, and therefore $u$ will be added to $S$ in each iteration. Since this check is done on all edges we know that the algorithm will produce a valid vertex cover. Furthermore, if $u = 0.5$ and $v = 0.5$, it will not add both $u, v$ to $S$, but instead only add $u$ and continue with the iteration. Therefore, it will never have a larger cost than that of the LP relaxation solution in (b). In fact, it will have a lower cost, since we know from (a) that the optimal number of vertices is $70$, thus there will be comparisons of edges where one or both vertices are included in $S$.\n",

    "<!-- Compare the cost of the solution produced by this rule to the optimal solution. -->\n",
    "The cost of the optimal solution is $70$ compared to $93$ in this solution. It is much worse than the optimal solution, but slightly better than the LP relaxation solution in (b). Since there are no \"intelligent\" iteration through the list of edges, the alhorithm adds vertices continuously while iterating through the edges. Some of these vertices will be redundant to the optimal vertex cover (if it is not the case that specifically the first 70 vertices is part of the vertex cover). Therefore, the number of vertices is much higher than in the optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, by simply adding $v$ insatead of $u$ in each iteration, a better vertex cover (77 nodes) will be created without any optimization or comparisons of nodes. Adding $u$ or $v$ randomly will produce a solution of about 80-90 vertices. This points to the fact that the order of edges are of most importance when utilizing this method. See below for a visualization."
