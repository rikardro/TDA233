        "You are newly recruited as a Data Scientist at a leading consultancy company in Gothenburg. Your first task at the job is to help the Swedish Public Health Agency (folkh√§lsomyndigheten) for predicting the diabetes progression of patients. Assume that you are given a dataset D of $n$ patients with $D = \\{ (\\mathbf{x}_i, y_i)\\}_{i=1}^n$ where $\\mathbf{x}_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^p$ represents numerical features of each patients and $y_i \\in \\mathbb{R}$ represent the numerical diabetes progression.  One can also view the dataset D as a pair of matrices $(\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{y})$ with $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p}$ and $\\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times 1}$.\n",

        "Fresh with the lectures in the machine learning course at Chalmers, you would like to use a linear model to quickly perform the task. In order words, you would like to find a vector $\\mathbf{w} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p \\times 1}$  such that $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{w}$.  However,  you have just read one of the most popular machine learning books and it argues that standard linear regression (for finding $\\mathbf{w}$) can lead to various problems such as non-uniqueness of the solution,  overfitting, etc. As a result, you decided to add a penalty term called regularization to control the optimisation problem. More specifically, you want to solve for: $\\min_{\\mathbf{w}}  \\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{w})$ where  $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{w}) = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{x}_i)^2 \\right) + \\left(\\alpha \\sum_{j=1}^p w_j^2 \\right) $ with $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$ a small coefficient that you will decide later on.\n",

We also appended $1$ to the begining of $\\mathbf{x}_n$ so both $\\mathbf{x}_n$ and $\\mathbf{w}$ were in $\\mathbb{R}^{D+1}$. Thus, here $p$ is the same thing as $D+1$. Compare $w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_p$ with $w_0, w_1, \\dots, w_D$."
