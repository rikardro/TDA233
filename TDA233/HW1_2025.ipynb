However,  you have just read one of the most popular machine learning books and it argues that standard linear regression (for finding $\\mathbf{w}$) can lead to various problems such as non-uniqueness of the solution,  overfitting, etc. As a result, you decided to add a penalty term called regularization to control the optimisation problem. More specifically, you want to solve for: $\\min_{\\mathbf{w}}  \\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{w})$ where  $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{w}) = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{x}_i)^2 \\right) + \\left(\\alpha \\sum_{j=1}^p w_j^2 \\right) $ with $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$ a small coefficient that you will decide later on.\n",

    "First, since $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{w})$ is convex, it guarantees a unique global minimum. Therefore, we only have to show that $(X^TX + \\alpha I)$ is an invertible matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "Wikipedia states that \"a symmetric matrix $M$ with real entries is positive-definite if the real number $x^⊤ M x$ is positive for every nonzero real column vector $x$\". Hence, we need to show that $(X^TX + \\alpha I)$ is symmetric, has real entries, and that $z^T(X^TX + \\alpha I)z > 0$ for any nonzero, real column vector $z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "By definition we know that $(X^TX + \\alpha I)$ is symmetric, so the first condition on $\\alpha$ is that it is a real number.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to show that $z^T(X^TX + \\alpha I)z > 0$. Expanding $z^T(X^TX + \\alpha I)z$ we get $z^TX^TXz + \\alpha z^TIz = |Xz|^2_2 + \\alpha |z|^2_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$|Xz|^2_2 + \\alpha |z|^2_2 > 0 \\Leftrightarrow \\alpha > - \\frac{|Xz|^2_2}{|z|^2_2}$. It is clear that the fraction of two squared norms is positive, so we need to have $\\alpha > -y$ for some $y > 0$. It is also clear that if $\\alpha > 0$, the inequality will always hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the inequality must hold for any nonzero real $z$, and we must not make any assumptions on $X$, the second condition on $\\alpha$ is that it must be $\\alpha > 0$."
